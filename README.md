# Hostel-Management-System
This Hostel Management System is designed to ease the workflow in universities and colleges so as to make the hostel allocation fast and less complex. 
The system users have 2 types of roles which are the Administrator(Warden) and Students. 
Both users must log in with their apt login credentials to gain access to the features and functionalities of the application. 
The Administrator has the privilege to allocate and manage the rooms to the students applying as per their requests.
While Students on the other hand, as logically obvious, can register and obviously raise a request for the allotment of the room. 
This Hostel Management System allows the admin to manage the list of hostel rooms, and student requests. 
The admin must populate first the list of rooms in the system, and students have to raise a request. 
Once that been done, the proctor can simply use the assign_room feature to assign the rooms on the first-come-first-serve bases. 
The system was developed with user-friendly features and. 
It can help the college management to efficiently and effectively manage the collections and account records.
